For a Technology Team Manager, the process improvement in search of agility and productivity is indispensable. For that, data is very important.


However, for teams that use the [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/) for writing your tasks, doesnâ€™t exists a in-depth detail about what occurs with the WorkItems and the Azure DevOps Queries available are limiteds.

With **Azure DevOps Tracker** will be possible to obtain detailed informations about the cycle time of each Workitem, as all data are automatically stored in your SQL Server Database.


The **Azure DevOps Tracker** brings automatically tracking of Workitems and will help managers with:
### Statistics:
âœ… Of the Team
 
 âœ… From specific Team Members
 
 âœ… Total time per State
  
 âœ… Worked time per State
  
 ### Cycle time sampling of:
 
  âœ… An iteration or Sprint
  
  âœ… A Workitem
  
  âœ… A Project

 ### - Changelog: With Azure DevOps Tracker you can easily inform what was done by your team. Actually, we have integration with Microsoft Teams and Discord!

 ### Possibility to connect to a BI Tool ðŸ“Š
 ### Your creativity is the limit! ðŸš€
